Git branching is a core feature that allows developers to diverge from the main line of development to work on new features or bug fixes in an isolated environment. These branches are lightweight pointers to a snapshot of changes, making them efficient to create and switch between. Once the work is complete and tested, the changes can be integrated back into the main codebase through a process called merging.
